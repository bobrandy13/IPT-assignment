          <h1>Objects</h1>
          <h2>what is an object????</h2>

          <p>
            An object is essentially a thing that has different characteristics.
            For example, humans could be an object. They have different
            attributes such as name, height, weight, shape. They can also have
            functoins as part of the object. For example, humans can walk, talk,
            run. Its more of a way to bundle them together.
          </p>
          <h3>Here is an example</h3>
          <pre>
            <code>
                class Human {
                    constructor(name, age) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.age = age;
                    }

                    string talk() {
                        console.log("Yapping!");
                    }
                }

                const myFriend = new Human("Avi Gupta", 3);
                myDog.talk();
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h3>
            Here in the above example, the myFriend is an object. It is
            different from the class itself as that is the code itself that
            defines the Human. For example, class HUman is the class, where as
            myFriend is the object.
          </h3>
        </li>
        <li><h1>Attirubtes</h1></li>
        <h2>Different objects can have different attributes</h2>

        <pre>
            <code>
                class Human {
                    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
                        this.name = name; <-- This is an attribute
                        this.age = age; <-- so is this one
                    }
                }
                </code> </pre>

        <p>
          For example, a dog can have a name, age, breed, and color. A human can
          have a name, age, height, weight, and hair color. These are all
          different attributes that are unique to the object.
        </p>

          <pre>
            <code>
                class Human {
                    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.age = age;
                    }
                    // this below is a method. It is a function that is part of the object that does something
                    talk() { 
                        console.log(`${this.name} is yapping!`);`
                    }
                }

                const myBestFriend = new Human("Avi Gupta", 30000);
                myBestFriend.talk(); <-- Output : "Avi Gupta is yapping!"
            </code>
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>Variables and Control Structures</h1>
          Variables are like storage containers. They can store stuff.
          <pre><code>
                let x = 5;
                let y = 10;
                let z = x + y;
                console.log(z); // Output: 15
            </code></pre>
          Thats literally it.
