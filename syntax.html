        <h1>What is abstraction?</h1>

        <h2>
          Abstraction is like playing with a remote control car. You don't know
          at all how the motor works, or the inner workings. But you just use
          the remote. That is essence is abstraction.
        </h2>

        <h3>
          In code it looks something like this. In Object Oriented code, you
          have stuff that is private and public. What this means is that private
          attributes and methods are only visible from within that class.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          For example.The car itself may be able to check whether it has fuel.
          But you as the user cannot check . This is known as a private method.
          But a public method that everyone has access to, for example, is to
          the .drive() method. You can drive, that attriute is public.
        </h3>

        <pre>
          <code>
class Car:
  def __init__(self, fuel):
      self.__fuel = fuel <-- this is a private attribute (private variable)

  def __check_fuel(self): <-- this is a private method
      return self.__fuel

  def drive(self): <-- this is a public attribute. 
      if (__check_fuel() == 0): <-- however this is ok, because I am acessing it within the class. 
          print("No fuel")
      else:
          print("Vroom!")
      print("Vroom!")

ferrari = new Car(100) 

ferrari.drive() <-- this is okay
ferrari.__check_fuel() <-- this is not okay as it is a private attribute.

        <h1>Instantiation</h1>
        <h2>
          Its basically just the creation of a class. For exmaple, if you just
          made a class. THen you could instantiate it with the following code;
        </h2>

        <pre>
          <code>
car = new Car("ferrari", "red", 100) <- this code is calling upon the class Car that we defined earlier
          </code>
        </pre>
      </li>

      <h1>Inheritance</h1>

      <h3>What is inheritance? Using the car class we just defined earlier.</h3>
      <h4>
        What if we wanted to make a porsche? OR a lambo ? or a honda. Would you
        make a new class for each? But they are all cars. So no. You would
        "inherit" the class, and then add the unique properties of the cars.
      </h4>

      <pre>
        <code>
class Porsche extends car:
  def __init__(self, fuel):
      self.__fuel = fuel
      self.__brand = "Porsche"
      self.__color = "Red"
      self.__speed = 100
  def drive(self):
    print("VROOOOOOM ") <-- the porsche is much louder than a normal car. So we can adjust it here. 
          </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>
        The porsche class is the exact same as a car class. But it has a
        different drive method. This is what inheritance allows us to do.
      </h3>
